Coding Exercise

    Read an ascii input file, reverse the contents and write the reversed contents to an output file.
    Use TDD
    Your unit test should not hit the file system.



Example

Input.txt contains "ABC".

After processing, output.txt should contain "CBA".



Note: This should be written in Java or Kotlin (core java, no Spring please).



========================================================================================================================

1. Replace "input.txt" in main class with path of file whose contents needs to be reversed.
2. Replace "out.txt" in main class with desired output filepath.
